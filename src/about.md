# About this blog

I came to this pond in the woods because I want to live deliberately, to focus on the stuff that matters and see if I can figure out what life has to teach me. I don't want to reach the end of my life and realize I haven't truly lived. Life is incredibly precious; I don't want to spend it on things that don’t matter.

I want to live fully and deeply, to get everything I can out of life. My goal is to strip away all the junk. If life is difficult, I want to face that difficulty head-on and share that truth with the world. If it's beautiful, I want to experience that fully and share it here on this blog.
